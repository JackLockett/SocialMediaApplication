# Minimal Social Media Application

## Client Requirements

This application will require users to register by providing information such as their full name, preferred display name, email address, phone number, a description of themselves, and a photo. After submitting the registration form, an activation link will be sent to the user's email address. The account will not be activated until the user clicks the link.

Once usersâ€™ registration is complete, they will be able to upload additional photos. However, the photo will not be displayed until it has been verified as acceptable. Aside from that, users can add other users as friends by sending a friend request. The friend list will be updated once the request has been approved.

Administrators have the authority to deactivate any user who is found to be misbehaving by uploading inappropriate photos or using vulgar words when describing themselves.

The system's front end can be developed as web-based.
